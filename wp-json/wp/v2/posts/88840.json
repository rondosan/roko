It\u2019s these bullet points that help you focus on the topic at hand. Every assessment differs and focuses on different topics, and it helps to plan around your points. Once you have all the points you need to talk about, try and extend them further. For example, if you had an assessment due on Business Law, and you have a point for your answer, add to your point, take it to a deeper level. Its by doing this that you are showing the tutor\/examiner that you have explored each point in detail and have truly focused on the assessment.<\/p>\n<h2>Quality, not Quantity<\/h2>\n<p>Exploring points is always a good idea, however, have you ever heard of the saying \u2018Quality, not Quantity?\u2019 It\u2019s true, your tutor is able to tell when you are dragging out your points by adding unnecessary details. Stick to the point you need to raise, explore it in detail, but only if exploration is needed, if the point doesn\u2019t need to be taken deeper, then there is no use in waffling on. Yes, you may have a word limit or minimum you need to hit, but keep your writing concise and as close to what you have been asked to discuss.<\/p>\n<h2>Include different levels of Sentences<\/h2>\n<p>A great tip for writing assessments, especially English assessments, is to include a variation of sentences. That includes, long and short sentences. These help your points in a different manor and shows your tutor that you can explain your point both in detail, and within a shorter form too. When using different lengths of sentences, it also adds to depth to your assessment and makes it more intriguing to read.<\/p>\n<h2>Provide both sides to the argument<\/h2>\n<p>Obviously, only if the assessment requires to do so. Many assessments ask that students argue both for and against the question. If you are asked to do, make sure you raise both sides of the argument to a high level, this can be done by keeping your points strong and concise. If you find that one side outweighs the other, make those points for that side stronger. Also, when concluding your assessment, you will need to voice which side of the argument you agree with. In doing so, rounding up the points in your favour will help show the tutor that you have looked at both sides of the argument on a deep level and have come a conclusion effectively. <\/p>\n<h2>Consistency with Tenses<\/h2>\n<p>One issue that students can face is moving back and forth between the past and present tenses. When writing an assessment, it is best to either stick to the present or past tense. However, if your assessment requires you to switch between the past and present tenses, make sure you do so carefully as it can get quite confusing for the reader if done so incorrectly.<\/p>\n<h2>Take advantage of the online Thesaurus<\/h2>\n<p>A great tip for writing assessments and taking them to the next level is to use a physical or online thesaurus. By using a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thesaurus.com\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Thesaurus<\/a> you are able to expand your vocabulary and that will come across in your piece. Simple words like however and therefore can be overused in assessments, but, with a thesaurus, you are able to find another word that you need, but one that holds the same meaning.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rcl.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Writing-assessment-for-higher-education-college-students.jpg\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.rcl.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Writing-assessment-for-higher-education-college-students.jpg\" alt=\"Writing assessment for higher education college students\" width=\"100%\" height=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-88842\" srcset=\"https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Writing-assessment-for-higher-education-college-students.jpg 1202w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Writing-assessment-for-higher-education-college-students-768x511.jpg 768w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Writing-assessment-for-higher-education-college-students-991x660.jpg 991w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Writing-assessment-for-higher-education-college-students-150x100.jpg 150w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Writing-assessment-for-higher-education-college-students-576x383.jpg 576w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Writing-assessment-for-higher-education-college-students-992x660.jpg 992w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Writing-assessment-for-higher-education-college-students-1200x799.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1202px) 100vw, 1202px\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Plan, Draft, Read and Edit<\/h2>\n<p>The most important thing you can do is to plan, draft, read and edit your assessment. Plan all your points in detail, make sure you have them in the correct order and that they flow effectively. Then draft, write as many drafts as you need, it\u2019s with a draft that you are able to make the changes you need to make your assessment the best possible. Next up is reading, read and read your assessments a good few times and also, read it out loud. When reading out loud, you will be able to pick up on grammar and punctuation mistakes and you will get a real feel of how the tutor will read your assessment. And lastly, edit your assessment as much as you wish, when you edit, you will find that some points may be unnecessary, or that there are some more you wish to add.<\/p><\/div>\n\n\t\t\t            \t<div class=\"bottom-row__sidebar side-cards\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":88841,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[34],"tags":[],"course-type":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.4.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Tips for Writing Assessments for Students |Regent College<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Writing Assessments can take quite some time to complete, but the relief when they are done is the best feeling.
