Regent Group was founded in 2000 as an independent secondary school and sixth form college, known as Regent College London and sited in Harrow. The Group grew over the years expanding into supplementary education, additional secondary and sixth form provision, nursery provision and in 2010 established its Higher Education Division.<br \/>\nThe Higher Education Division started with only a handful of students, students within our sixth form who wanted an alternative to a traditional university route, a course that would allow them to link theory to practice. However, with time, the division blossomed into the entity that it is today providing education to over 1,200 students on six Edexcel Higher National Diploma (HND) Business courses. We have a busy site with a team of management, administrative, support and teaching staff that work very well with one another. We are also most fortunate to have some very experienced and respected individuals within our team including our Principal, Dr Michael Pinfold, former Head of Collaborative Provision at the University of Gloucestershire, and our Director of Quality Enhancement, Professor Donald Pennington, previously pro-vice chancellor at the University of Coventry; Dr Paul Hartley, former vice chancellor at Gloucestershire, acts as an advisor for our HE division.<br \/>\nAs part of this, to accommodate our large student body, there has been significant investment in improving the estate, and offering a high-class learning environment for students engaged in studying for their disciplines. The Group has obtained and fitted out a new building in the bustling and vibrant area of Wembley Park.<br \/>\nThe ethos of our institution encourages students to be independent learners within a supportive atmosphere and a bespoke environment, with all academic requirements being provided, and a friendly, welcoming and supportive team of tutors and administrators on hand. We see the students as stakeholders, and as such students are actively encouraged to make their views known.<br \/>\nWe promote a forward-looking and inclusive environment, and our aim is to ensure that everyone involved with higher education plays a part in the decision-making processes, is accountable, and is valued. Indeed at our most recent Review for Educational Oversight by the Quality Assurance Agency, we were praised, for, \u2018the effective dissemination of College actions in response to student requests\u2019 and during our very recent Standards Verifier visit Pearson recorded that,\u00a0 \u2018Communication between tutors and learners is first class.\u2019 We feel that we have, without question, met the objectives laid out in the 2011 White Paper, \u2018Students at the Heart of the System.\u2019<\/p>\n<style type=\"text\/css\">.post-featured{ display:none; } <\/style><\/div>\n\n\t\t\t            \t<div class=\"bottom-row__sidebar side-cards\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":87872,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[52],"tags":[],"course-type":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.4.1 -
