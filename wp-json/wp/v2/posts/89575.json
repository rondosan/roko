HNDs are work-related, or vocational, higher education qualifications. HND is a higher education qualification of United Kingdom, which can be used to enrol into universities at an advanced level. A Higher National Diploma is equivalent to the second year of a three year degree and is an RQF Level 4 and 5 Course.<\/p>\n<p>A HND qualification will allow you to further progress your studies as you can go onto study a Top-up degree too! A Top-up degree allows you to achieve a full Bachelor\u2019s degree with one additional year of study. Regent College London offers HNDs in Business and are sure to help further your interest in the ever-changing world of Business.<\/p>\n<p>HNDs are designed to help prepare you for the world of work, which is why this qualification is very much valued by employers. HNDs are available in the UK and in other countries too, although they have different entry requirements, they remain a great qualification to achieve and are a globally recognised qualification.<\/p>\n<h2>Who is a HND for?<\/h2>\n<p>There is no age limit on studying for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rcl.ac.uk\/should-i-take-a-higher-national-diploma-hnd\/\">HND<\/a>, anyone can apply depending on entry requirements and qualifications achieved. HNDs are great for those who like to learn through doing practical types of learning. If you know what career you are aiming to enter, a HND can offer more of a direct route into that industry. There are many individuals who can look to study a HND such as:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>School Leavers<\/li>\n<li>Mature students returning to education (with related work experience)<\/li>\n<li>Individuals in employment who wish to improve their career prospects and<\/li>\n<li>Individuals who wish to start their own business<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>How long does it take to complete a HND?<\/h2>\n<p>This is completely dependent on which basis you choose to take your course. It can be completed within 2 years, if you are able to study full time or 4 years if you wish to study part time.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the Advantages and Disadvantages?<\/h2>\n<p>Naturally, you may be wondering what the advantages and disadvantages are of taking a HND, well, we have outlined a couple for each which may end up helping you make your decision.<\/p>\n<h2>Advantages of studying a HND:<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>As a HND offers a direct route into your career, you will be able to gain a good amount of valuable skills, knowledge and understanding needed for your career path.<\/li>\n<li>With a HND, you will be able to Top-up your degree and gain a complete Level 6 qualification.
