We all know the traditional route is to take a 3-4 year Bachelor\u2019s, while that may be the case for many, for other students, they opt to take different routes. One way of achieving the full Bachelor\u2019s Level 6 Qualification is by taking an FdSc Degree, otherwise known as a Foundation Degree. At Regent College London, we offer an <a href=\"\/courses\/foundation-degrees\/fdsc-business-management\/\">FdSc Degree in Business Management<\/a>. Today\u2019s blog post should be able to help give you an insight of what a Foundation Degree may look like if you choose to take it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rcl.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/foundation-degree-fdSc-business-management.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-88025\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rcl.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/foundation-degree-fdSc-business-management.jpg\" alt=\"Foundation Degree | FdSc - Business Management\" width=\"100%\" height=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/foundation-degree-fdSc-business-management.jpg 1202w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/foundation-degree-fdSc-business-management-768x511.jpg 768w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/foundation-degree-fdSc-business-management-991x660.jpg 991w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/foundation-degree-fdSc-business-management-150x100.jpg 150w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/foundation-degree-fdSc-business-management-576x383.jpg 576w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/foundation-degree-fdSc-business-management-992x660.jpg 992w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/foundation-degree-fdSc-business-management-1200x799.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1202px) 100vw, 1202px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What is a Foundation Degree?<\/h2>\n<p>A foundation degree is the academic equivalent of two-thirds of a Bachelors degree or a Higher National Diploma (HND). A Foundation Degree is a two-year stand-alone qualification in its own right. After completing this you can go to the final year of degree as well or complete a Top-up and gain a degree. This qualification is equivalent to two-thirds of a Bachelor\u2019s degree, and a Higher National Diploma (HND): Level 4 and 5. A Top-up Degree will then provide you with a Level 6 Qualification.<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s the difference between a Foundation Degree and a Foundation Year with Degree?<\/h2>\n<p>This can get pretty confusing for some students as they both sound very similar. However, they are totally different degree types and the duration of the degrees highly differ. A Foundation Year with Degree, is an extra year of learning and gaining new skills and knowledge before moving onto a BSc or BA. If you pass the foundation year, it\u2019s almost, very likely you will move onto the 1st or 2nd Year of a Bachelor\u2019s (Hons) Degree. However, Foundation Degree is a two-year stand-alone qualification in its own right. After completing this you can go to the final year of degree as well or complete Top-up and get a degree.<\/p>\n<h2>How long is a foundation degree?<\/h2>\n<p>A Foundation Degree at Regent College London takes 2 Years.<\/p>\n<h2>What can i do with a Foundation Degree?<\/h2>\n<p>As with successfully completing any Degree, your chances of employment within your chosen field increase.
