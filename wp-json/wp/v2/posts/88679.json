Inviting students to take a broad view on what wealth consists in is an important piece of the puzzle. Monetary wealth, and the principles required to achieve monetary wealth in times of economic crisis are also closely examined. Here the view is taken that our attitude to opportunity, our capacity to develop ourselves, and our ability to use our imaginations to engage in entrepreneurial ventures are critical to the creation of material wealth. Here students are learning to develop a new framework within which to prepare and plan for their next move as they leave <a href=\"\/our-college\/why-study-at-regent\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Regent College<\/a> and broaden their horizons in the world of work. <\/p>\n<p>The programme, which launched last Saturday (7-11-2020), has gathered support from both students and teachers alike. In response to the question, \u201cwhat did you learn from this lesson,\u201d students commented:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI learnt about money and I know now it\u2019s all about flow, I learnt that there are laws that are involved in getting rich.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe all have equal opportunities to progress and achieve no matter where you are, and it is your mindset that directs you to your destiny.\u201d  <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am interested to learn more on the difference between man-made Laws &#038; the Universal Laws, which relate to the accumulation of wealth.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The new Wealth Creation Programme is facilitated by the Principal of Regent College London and the CEO of Regent Group, Dr. Selva Pankaj. Dr. Selva has a long history of facilitating programmes that explore human capacities and human potential, having studied under Professor Clayton Christensen as part of his executive education at Harvard Business School.<\/p>\n<p>The Wealth Creation Programme is available not just for our students, but to everyone.
