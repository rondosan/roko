The wedding has been planned to perfection; the only wild card here is the wedding\u2019s guest list.

Written when the speaker, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family&#8217;s history that began before he was born \u2014 a history whose epicentre is rooted in Vietnam \u2014 and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity.<\/p>\n<p>Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, On Earth We&#8217;re Briefly Gorgeous is as much about the power of telling one&#8217;s own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.<\/p>\n<h2>The Power of Learning from Dad: Desire.

It warmly combines paternal wisdom with the teachings of many eminent authors on human potential, human behaviour and success, creating a seminal work on harnessing the powers we have within us to achieve our goals, and the power of learning from our parents.<\/p>\n<p>The book was inspired by Dr. Selva Pankaj\u2019s later father. These words evoked memories of the lessons that Selva had first been taught by his late father, growing up in war-torn Sri Lanka and then later building his success in the United Kingdom.<\/p>\n<p>The Power of Learning from DAD develops the idea that success is rooting in a way of thinking and is available to anyone who studies and adopts the mindset of successful individuals<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u2018\u2019Not only does this book make a powerful case for the impact desire, attitude and decision making can have on your life but it is a first-hand account of how to put those ideas into practice.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Foreword by<br \/>\nThe Right Honourable Jeremy Hunt MP.
