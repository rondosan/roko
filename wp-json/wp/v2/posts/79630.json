The court was described by the BBC as \u201cprobably the most famous criminal court in the world\u201d which has more than 1000 years of criminal history behind the closed doors and its walls.<br \/>\nAs the security checks were very strict, students were split into two groups. The first group of three students went in to witness a trial relating to terrorism and theft cases.<br \/>\nThe second group went in an hour later to another court where jury selection were taking place. As the names of jurors were called one by one, some accepted the duty and some were excused on grounds of \u201cother pressing appointments\u201d. The whole session took about 30-40 minutes and the judge advised the jurors on how and what to listen for in the trial.<br \/>\nThe students were happy to witness the live-hearing and later exchanged views on their experience to other students.<br \/>\nThis is the second trip organised by the Business Law Pathway group. The first trip was in May 2015 where the students visited the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which sits in the former Middlesex Guildhall, on the western side of Parliament Square.<\/p><\/div>\n\n\t\t\t            \t<div class=\"bottom-row__sidebar side-cards\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[52],"tags":[],"course-type":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.4.1 -
