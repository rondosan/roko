The second programme, Think and Grow Rich provides a summation of Napoleon Hill\u2019s best-selling book of the same title, distilling Hill\u2019s concepts in easy to understand and easy to implement steps.<\/p>\n<p>Both programmes are written and presented by Dr. Selva Pankaj and add to the award-winning programme, Thinking into Character, as forms of asynchronous learning. With asynchronous learning, students can access lessons at any time, from any location and complete courses at their own pace. This form of delivery is part of our wider Regent Digital strategy, devised in March 2020, which embraces new technologies as a way of innovating education and bringing improved services to students and customers.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rcl.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/TiC-POLD-and-TAGR-digital-learning-platforms.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-88833\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rcl.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/TiC-POLD-and-TAGR-digital-learning-platforms.jpg\" alt=\"TiC-POLD-and-TAGR-digital-learning-platforms\" width=\"100%\" height=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/TiC-POLD-and-TAGR-digital-learning-platforms.jpg 912w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/TiC-POLD-and-TAGR-digital-learning-platforms-768x354.jpg 768w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/TiC-POLD-and-TAGR-digital-learning-platforms-150x69.jpg 150w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/TiC-POLD-and-TAGR-digital-learning-platforms-576x265.jpg 576w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>On Wednesday 9 December, in a launch event attended by students, staff and invited guests, the latest additions to our personal development programmes went live. Members of the team demonstrated the new digital programmes, which are now updated and available to view on the platform <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tic.uk.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.tic.uk.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The Power of Learning from DAD and Think and Grow Rich add breadth and depth to our existing digital programme, Thinking into Character. At the launch, all stakeholders in the Regent team, from students to lecturers to members of the Senior Leadership Team chose one concept from The Power of Learning from DAD and in their own ways described the significance of that concept to them.<\/p>\n<p>Focusing on the need for students to incorporate these wider lessons as part of a holistic curriculum at Regent College London, Akosua Bonsu, Director of Studies for Thinking into Character and launch organiser, wrote:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSuccessfully teaching subject knowledge is not enough for students to achieve the success that they desire as it is the ability to apply subject knowledge that leads to those successes. This ability to apply subject knowledge has to do with a students\u2019 imagination, the capacity of their will, their ability to spot opportunities and so on. It is these ingredients, often missing from the taught curriculum, that we are aiming to deliver by means of these new digital programmes: The Power of Learning from Dad and Thinking and Grow Rich. In this way, Regent College London is a pioneer in closing the knowing-doing gap so prevalent in the education system and empowering students to achieve success\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We are delighted with the new additions The Power of Learning from Dad and Think and Grow Rich. As with Thinking into Character, a careful study of these programmes will develop in you the mindset required for success and self-fulfilment.
