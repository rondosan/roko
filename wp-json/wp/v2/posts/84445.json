I had experienced being treated as a number and as a statistic rather than as a human being.<br \/>\nThe fact that the occupants of Grenfell had suffered so much loss through the decisions of persons who did not appear to care reminded me of my own experience.<br \/>\n<strong>Unite as One<\/strong><br \/>\nThe motivation for writing my song was the raw emotion and realization of what had happened to the residents of Grenfell.<br \/>\nI felt that so many lives had been lost through ignorance, lack of empathy and an obvious division between rich and poor communities. This feeling became the truth of my song.<br \/>\nI wrote and recorded the song quickly. Although the recording at the time was still quite raw and not fully mastered, I released it alongside a video highlighting not only Grenfell, but unnecessary and preventable suffering around the world.<br \/>\nI wanted the voices of those people who might have felt powerless around the world to be heard, and at the same time, to highlight our common humanity, our common rights. I wanted to use this song and my voice to open the hearts of listeners and remind them that there is more that unites us than divides us.<br \/>\nThis is why the song is called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XETllOqvCHE&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unite as One<\/a><\/p>\n<style type=\"text\/css\">.post-featured{ display:none; } <\/style><\/div>\n\n\t\t\t            \t<div class=\"bottom-row__sidebar side-cards\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":11,"featured_media":1475,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[52],"tags":[],"course-type":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.4.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Unite as One - Regent College London<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"I was completely shocked, upset and angered by what had been allowed to happen at Grenfell Tower.
