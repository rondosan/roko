We held our first official open day since moving into the new campus, opened our new office in Asia and further plans are in place to open recruitment offices across Europe. This is to help local, EU and International applicants interested in studying our Higher Education programme; the programme offers a HND in Business with a choice from five separate pathways in Management, Marketing, Business Law, Human Resources, and Accounting.<br \/>\nThe biggest news of the moment was Regent College London\u2019s involvement in London\u2019s largest Jobs and Skills Fair for 15 \u2013 24 year olds and their families. We joined top employers, trainers and educators from across the UK and met thousands of young people interested in finding out the next steps in their academic aspirations and career prospects. Along with students, we also had the opportunity to cultivate positive rapport with teachers, consultants and of course the anxious yet excited parents keen to find the right course and institute for their child.<br \/>\nWith a fresh and early start to the day for members of staff representing Regent College London at the fair, not to mention a two hour delay in typical London traffic on the way to the Excel Conference Hall located in the Docklands of East London, all was set and ready for the long and exciting day ahead. It wasn\u2019t too long until the crowds came flooding in. Students were eager with questions about where we are, what we do, and what life at Regent is like, with the more overwhelming questions coming from the parents who were determined to get every detail right. Staff responded gladly, providing impartial advice and guidance on all the programmes and services available, by engaging the visitors with focused taster activities; inspiring, entertaining and most importantly informing them about the genuine opportunities available, leaving students, parents and the public completely satisfied with what they were getting.<br \/>\nOver the space of two days from Friday 21<sup>st<\/sup> to Saturday 22<sup>nd<\/sup> November, the London Skills Fair 2014 was an opportunity for Regent College London to inspire, guide, advise and promote our products and services, such as the range of Higher National Diploma in Business programmes.<br \/>\nWith over 33,000 visitors who attended the fair over the space of two days, it was an exhilarating time for Regent College London. We used the opportunity to really make an impression not only with the visitors who attended, but with other contributing organisations and institutes. We built a strong rapport and were able to network effectively with other attending companies, in order to establish key working relationships and future partnerships.<br \/>\nWith more busy months to come, including the January 2015 intake for the HND in business programme, applicants have the opportunity to come and visit us at the Wembley Campus, call or email us to register their interest, and to become a part of the Regent journey to success.<\/p>\n<style type=\"text\/css\">.post-featured{ display:none; } <\/style><\/div>\n\n\t\t\t            \t<div class=\"bottom-row__sidebar
