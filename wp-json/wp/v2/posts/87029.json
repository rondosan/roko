From, Bachelor\u2019s Degrees, to Top-ups to Foundation Year with Degrees, we&#8217;re here today to let you know everything you need to know about taking a Foundation Year with Degree at Regent College London. A Foundation Year with degree provides you with an insight into the world of Higher Education.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a Foundation Year with Degree?<\/h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"\/foundation-year-courses\/\">Foundation Year with Degree<\/a> provides an extra year of study right at the beginning of the degree. It\u2019s a great course for those who are still undecided on which course to study, mature students or those who haven\u2019t quite met the entry requirements. At Regent College London, we offer a range of degree courses with a Foundation Year that help offer you an alternative route to a traditional Bachelor\u2019s Degree. However, there is some confusion over the difference between a Foundation Year with Degree and a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rcl.ac.uk\/courses\/foundation-degrees\/\"> Foundation Degree<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s the difference between a Foundation Year with Degree and a Foundation Degree?<\/h2>\n<p>So, what is the difference? Well, a Foundation Year with Degree, is an extra year of learning and gaining new skills and knowledge before moving onto a BSc or BA. If you pass the foundation year, it\u2019s almost, very likely you will move onto the 1st or 2nd Year of a Bachelor\u2019s (Hons) Degree. However, Foundation Degree is a two year stand-alone qualification in its own right. After completing this you can go to the final year of degree as well or complete Top-up and get a degree. This qualification is equivalent to two-thirds of a Bachelor&#8217;s degree, and a Higher National Diploma (HND) so Level 4 and 5. A Top-up Degree will then provide you with a Level 6 Qualification.<\/p>\n<h2>Should I take a Foundation Year with Degree?<\/h2>\n<p>A Foundation Year study is a great way to build your skills, knowledge and confidence to prepare you for a degree course. Students get the chance to experience university-style teaching, get a feel of the campus, city and subjects they are interested in.
