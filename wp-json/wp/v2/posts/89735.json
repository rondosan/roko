For Undergraduates:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Tuition Fee Loan<\/b> &#8211; You may be eligible to borrow money to help pay for university or college tuition fees. This loan is then paid directly to your University to cover the cost of your course. This loan will need to be repaid, which is dependent on your income.<\/li>\n<li><b>Maintenance Loan<\/b> &#8211; Depending on your eligibility, you may be able to apply for a maintenance loan, which is designed to help you with the cost of living as a student. This loan is paid directly to you (at the start of each term). Unlike the tuition fee, this will be paid directly into your bank account. The amount you are entitled to is dependent on your household income. Similar to the Tuition Fee Loan, you will also need to pay this back.<\/li>\n<p>Whereas, for Postgraduates, the Postgraduate Loan is available:<\/p>\n<li><b>Postgraduate Loan<\/b> \u2013 This differs slightly from the structure of an Undergraduate loan as all of the money is paid directly to you as the student. It is your responsibility to pay the tuition fees to the University. You will be paid at the start of each term and the necessary payment will need to be made. It\u2019s important to note that this loan is given to cover the course of your university and living fees, so it may be worthwhile budgeting accordingly. Just like with the other Loans mentioned, this will also need to be repaid.<\/li>\n<p>There are also additional forms of support available: <\/p>\n<li>Childcare Grant<\/li>\n<li>Parent Learning Allowance<\/li>\n<li>Adult Dependents Grant<\/li>\n<li>Disabled Student Allowance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How do I apply for Student Finance?<\/h2>\n<p>The next important step is to apply! It may sound and feel like a daunting application but in actual fact, it\u2019s pretty simple and straightforward. You will need to have a few pieces of evidence and proof on hand to submit with your application, but whatever form of document you need will be asked from you within the application. We\u2019ve left a few pointers below on How to Apply for Student Finance:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can apply online via the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/student-finance\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Student Finance Website<\/a>.

This will mainly consist of you providing Student Finance with your personal details.<\/li>\n<li>Once you have created your account you will need to make your application (<b>please do this as soon as possible to avoid delays in the receipt of your funding<\/b>).<\/li>\n<li>The questions that follow will be about you and your personal circumstances.<\/li>\n<li>You will then be given options on what you\u2019re studying, the higher education level (Undergraduate\/Postgraduate) as well as the duration you plan to study for (Full-time\/Part\u0002time), in addition to other factors that Student Finance England will need to consider. It is extremely important that you select the correct university and course in order for your payments to be made in time as selecting the wrong course can delay the process of approval and also your payments being made, even if the application is approved.<\/li>\n<li>Once you have agreed to the Terms and Conditions and submitted your application, you will be presented with a checklist\/to do list on your account home page. This will tell you what additional information you need to send to Student Finance, which will be used to support your application.
