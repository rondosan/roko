We\u2019re pretty sure you may have come across these quotes, and rightly so, as they remain accurate. At <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rcl.ac.uk\/\"><strong>Regent College London<\/strong><\/a> we are proud to have a diverse student base who come from different walks of life. We encourage students of all ages to take up higher or further education with us, as it is true, \u2018You are never too old to learn\u2019. Have you ever thought about returning to education? And if so, have you thought about what you wish to learn, and how you can take your current career to a new level? Or perhaps, you have had a breakthrough and want to start a new career, but need the qualifications to do so? It can be quite scary going to university, or studying higher\/further at an older age, but it really doesn\u2019t need to be. We\u2019ve put together a quick blog post about being a mature student and returning to education.<br \/>\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-88814 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rcl.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/returning-to-higher-education.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" srcset=\"https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/returning-to-higher-education.jpg 1024w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/returning-to-higher-education-768x511.jpg 768w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/returning-to-higher-education-991x659.jpg 991w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/returning-to-higher-education-150x100.jpg 150w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/returning-to-higher-education-576x383.jpg 576w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/returning-to-higher-education-992x660.jpg 992w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Choosing Where and What to Study<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The first big step of re-entering education is choosing what to study and then finding the right establishment to study at. At Regent College London, we offer a great range of Higher and Further Qualifications, including <strong>University style degrees<\/strong> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rcl.ac.uk\/courses\/higher-national-diplomas\/\"><strong>Higher National Diploma\u2019s (HNDs)<\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong> Our degrees are partnered with great and world-renowned Universities. If you would like to know more about what courses we offer, you can find them <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rcl.ac.uk\/courses\/\">here<\/a>. Two main factors mature students look for are:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Location of the Campus:<\/strong> Many mature students like to stay closer to home, in order to fulfil any existing life commitments. When choosing where to study, its essential to know of your route to getting to campus and what other facilities are available, such as car parking. Regent College London have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rcl.ac.uk\/campuses\/\">5 Campus Locations<\/a> across London, all with great transport links.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The Length\/Duration of your Course:<\/strong> Many students often can\u2019t commit to a longer length of degree, which is why it\u2019s essential to know of the duration of your degree. From choosing your degree, you will be able to plan around your future and any other commitments you might be faced with.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Preparing for Study<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re older, there can be a lot more to think about when making life decisions, it can be a pretty scary thought. Preparing for academic life might be a challenge, but preparing yourself can make everything a lot easier. Just knowing that you have things in place that will help you along your higher\/further education journey, and helps put your mind at ease. Before you start an application, try to think carefully about any additional support you will need during your transition to study. For example, if you have family commitments, you may need to look into childcare options or facilities to provide support. A few tips that might help you once you start studying are:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Taking time to Settle:<\/strong> Settling in will take time and adapting to student life can take some adjustment. It can prove quite challenging balancing your education with any life commitments. However, once you have firmly planted your feet on campus, you will be a very settled student!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Making friends:<\/strong> Everyone can face a challenge when making friends, but finding common interests with fellow students can help build bonds. Mature students often find common ground about work, family and general life commitments, so there really is no need to worry about getting to know your fellow students. Your friends will then be there to provide mutual support if you feel you need any help.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Juggling Commitments:<\/strong> We know as a mature student, you probably have more commitments and responsibilities than a student who has just left school. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can balance them all! It\u2019s a great thing that Regent College London offer flexible timetables with classes running during the Weekdays, Evenings and Weekends.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Financial Stability<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It can be quite a worry for those returning to education to think about Financial Stability. Higher Education is a massive investment in your future and once you have made the decision to study, you will need to consider how to fund your studies. There is student finance available for those who wish to take on a degree. At <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rcl.ac.uk\/8-reasons-to-choose-regent-college-london\/\">Regent College London<\/a>, we have dedicated Student Finance Officers to help you every step of the way of your Student Finance application.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be afraid to take the leap to study at Regent College London, we offer 1-2-1 support from the day you make an enquiry right through till when you graduate! Studying at Regent College London offers you a great chance to get ahead in your career by teaching you new skills that you can apply to everyday life.<\/p><\/div>\n\n\t\t\t            \t<div class=\"bottom-row__sidebar side-cards\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":88814,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[34],"tags":[],"course-type":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.4.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Returning To Higher Education | Adult Returning To College<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Looking to return to higher education?
