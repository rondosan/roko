A Master\u2019s Degree is also studied after a Bachelor\u2019s Degree but before a PhD.<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s the difference between a Master\u2019s Degree and PhD?<\/h2>\n<p>A PhD is a more advanced qualification, it looks at a particular subject area in a much more deeper level than an MSc Degree. A PhD also focuses on original research that gives a student a significantly new amount of knowledge. However, both a Master\u2019s Degree and PhD are postgraduate qualifications.<\/p>\n<h2>How long is a Master\u2019s Degree?<\/h2>\n<p>An MSc qualification at Regent College London is 1 year Degree.
