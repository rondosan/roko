It is also equivalent to the second year of a three-year degree. Higher National Diploma\u2019s are work-related, or vocational, higher education qualifications. HND is a higher education qualification of United Kingdom, which can be used to enrol into universities at an advanced level.<\/p>\n<p>A HND qualification will allow you to further progress your studies as you can go onto study a Top-up degree too!

Many individuals can choose to take a Higher National Diploma, they can include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>School leavers<\/li>\n<li>Mature students returning to education (with related work experience)<\/li>\n<li>Individuals in employment who wish to improve their career prospects and<\/li>\n<li>Individuals who wish to start their own business.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How long does it take to study a HND?<\/h2>\n<p>A HND is a 2 year duration and can be completed at <a href=\"\/7-reasons-to-choose-regent-college-london-rcl\/\">Regent College London<\/a>.
