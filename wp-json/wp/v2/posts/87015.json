Here is where we can help, with most degrees, you\u2019re likely to see a few letters before the topic and they can come in the form of BA or BSC. But, you may ask, what on earth do these mean? What is the difference between a BA or BSc? Are the qualifications the same? Which one can I get a better job with? Don\u2019t worry, you have come to the right place, as we\u2019re about to break it down for you!<\/p>\n<h2>What do BA and BSc actually stand for?<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s take it right back and start with the basics. BA stands for Bachelor of Arts, whereas BSc stands for Bachelors of Science. Both are undergraduate degree programmes and are used internationally. Here at Regent College London, we offer both <a href=\"\/bachelors-degree-courses\/\">BA and BSc<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a BA (Bachelor of Arts)?<\/h2>\n<p>A Bachelor of Arts degree can take 3 or 4 years, depending on the course you wish to study, the institution you study at and, the country you study in. A BA Degree allows a more expansive education as it is less specialized. Bachelor of Arts allows for more qualitative, creative thinking, whilst developing theoretical and critical thinking. This type of undergraduate degree also requires fewer credits. Art and English Courses are typically BA Degrees.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the Benefits of taking a Bachelor of Arts Degree?<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>A great way to stand out to employers:<\/strong> Studying a BA Degree can help provide you with a stepping stone into the ever-changing world of employment. With a successful degree, you are bound to stand out from the crowd.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Developing Skills and Knowledge:<\/strong> Undertaking a BA Degree, not only provides you with a great qualification, it can also teach you essential skills and knowledge that you can not only take into the workplace, but use in everyday life. You will gain critical skills that are needed in the work environment, for example, developing strong communication and written skills, as well as equipping you with organizational skills.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Gaining a strong interest:<\/strong> You are highly likely to gain a strong level of interest within the field you study. This not only allows you to explore many career opportunities within your degree, but also gives you a platform to do what you have a passion for.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>What is a BSc (Bachelor of Science)?<\/h2>\n<p>A Bachelor of Science, on the other hand, is slightly more focused on the subject and requires more credits. This type of Bachelor\u2019s undergraduate programme features a more technical, and mathematical approach. Whilst this degree does promote in depth and detailed thinking, it also improves analytical and statistical thinking. It is typically scientific courses that are BSc Degrees such as Computer Science, Health and Social Care etc.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the Benefits of taking a Bachelor of Science Degree?<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Great entry point:<\/strong> Similarly to the BA, studying a BSc, provides you with a great entry point into your chosen career path.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hands on experience:<\/strong> Some BSc Programmes offer sandwich courses with placements. These allow for 1 year of work experience, in the form of internships or paid jobs that allow you to explore the world of employment and gain a hands on experience.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Explore other avenues:<\/strong> Just because you are taking a BSc Degree, it doesn\u2019t mean you are limited to \u2018Science Specific\u2019 Subjects. There is flexibility to take interest and explore other routes and options.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>What\u2019s the actual difference between BA and BSc Degrees?<\/h2>\n<p>Well, to put it simply, the major difference is the learning behind the degrees. BA Degrees are qualitative and creative lead, whereas, BSc Degrees require a more mathematical and analytical approach.<\/p>\n<h2>Which Degree should I choose?<\/h2>\n<p>Most importantly, both degrees carry the same qualification, they will both earn you a credited degree. It truly depends on the course you wish to study, however, both BA and BSc Degrees are equally and globally valued.
