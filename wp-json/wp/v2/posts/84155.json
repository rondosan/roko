I became focused on improving her health. It was the only thought that I had. It was my only goal. I did not think about me, or anything else until 2014 when, by chance, started working for a care company.<br \/>\nThe company that I worked for provided door-to-door care services to the elderly. While working there, I realized that that this role was not at all what I truly want to do. The problem was not my daily tasks and responsibilities: I loved doing that. The problem was the way that the organisation was treating the elderly service users: its own customers. The employees were poorly coordinated, the rotas were unmanageable and the service users were charged far too much for a service that was inadequate.<br \/>\nI decided:<br \/>\nI have to do something. I have to improve the provision of care in some way. And most importantly, I have to drive this change WITH MY OWN HANDS.<br \/>\n<strong>A new direction<\/strong><br \/>\nFour years:<br \/>\nIt took me four years to complete the research needed in order to find out the best and most reliable strategy to help my customers.<br \/>\nIn the meantime, two colleagues employed to do the same role as me had actually left the company and opened up their own businesses in the care sector, taking with them the service users that they had been working with. When these ex-colleagues opened for business they started trading straight and they had a customer base.<br \/>\nIt was actually unlawful for an ex-employee to approach any customers or to manage an organisation offering similar care services. If an ex-employee wanted to manage similar care services, they had to wait a minimum six month. As I did not want to be in breach of my contract and I wanted to do things properly, to do the research and accumulate all of the relevant qualifications and experience, I waited.<br \/>\nI had chosen to do things the hard way.<br \/>\nI was persistent. As I researched more, my dream to provide good quality in-home care, became an ideal to work for.<br \/>\n<strong>HND at Regent College London<\/strong><br \/>\nIn 2017, I decided to work on the first item in the list on my Personal and Professional Development Plan and applied to study HND Business at Regent College London. I knew that to be successful I would need to improve my knowledge and learn how to manage a business successfully.<br \/>\nAt the end of my first semester, I decided that the moment had come. In January 2018, together with my wife Carmen, we registered Us4ALL Ltd with the Companies House. A care provider is not allowed to provide services to customers without receiving accreditation and we applied for.<br \/>\nIt was tough. Another seven months of courses, appointments and forms to be filled in. All while juggling our children and the Business HND. I have to admit we couldn`t do so without the unconditioned help from my father-in-law who decided to help us with our daughters. We just get our girls to the schools and then quickly running either to our Business HND course or a specialisation course for the Care Certificate. All together there were fifteen certificates for the accreditation beside HND.<br \/>\nFinally in July 2018 we received accreditation for our care company Us4All. It was such a marvellous moment when the accreditation certificate was handed to us. We could now legally trade as a care provider. We were so excited.<br \/>\n<strong>Patience was key<\/strong><br \/>\nWe began advertising Us4All as a new local care service provider. We were all over the places in our local community with posters, leaflets, and flyers. We tried Google-ads and other social media platforms to engage customers. We were sure to get at least a few customers, or so we thought.<br \/>\nWe have been waiting for the phone to ring. But unfortunately it did not. The phone remains silent.<br \/>\nTo understand what more could be done, we participated to seminars we asked for mentorship. Selva Pankaj, CEO of Regent College London then offered me this advice:<br \/>\n\u201cYou did everything that is required to advertise your business at this stage, you must be patient.<br \/>\nWhen you plant a tree, you will have to wait several years before it bears fruit!<br \/>\nThe customers will come.\u201d<br \/>\nAnd they did!<br \/>\n<strong>Our first customer<\/strong><br \/>\nFinally in April 2019, one person approached us and became our very first customer. On the 29th of April 2019, we issued our very first invoice.<br \/>\nNow you will ask, why is the piece called Sweet Sixteen?<br \/>\nThe answer is simple and clear as day light. It took us 16 years until we finally realised whom to say a big THANK YOU, to our daughter because she gave us a purpose in our lives.<br \/>\nArticle by Radu Tobol, edited by Akosua Bonsu<br \/>\n<strong>More about the business Us4All<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.us4all.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Us4all Website<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Us4AllLtd\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Us4all Facebook<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/us4all-care-a32938158\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Us4all Linked-in<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Radu is currently accepting new customers who required at home and personalised care.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.regentcollegelondon.com\/onemediadig\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/sweet-sixteen-01.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-84157 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https:\/\/www.regentcollegelondon.com\/onemediadig\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/sweet-sixteen-01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Sweet Sixteen\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.regentcollegelondon.com\/onemediadig\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/sweet-sixteen-05.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-84158 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https:\/\/www.regentcollegelondon.com\/onemediadig\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/sweet-sixteen-05-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Sweet Sixteen\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.regentcollegelondon.com\/onemediadig\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/sweet-sixteen-04.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-84159 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https:\/\/www.regentcollegelondon.com\/onemediadig\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/sweet-sixteen-04-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Sweet Sixteen\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.regentcollegelondon.com\/onemediadig\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/sweet-sixteen-02.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-84160 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https:\/\/www.regentcollegelondon.com\/onemediadig\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/sweet-sixteen-02-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Sweet Sixteen\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.regentcollegelondon.com\/onemediadig\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/sweet-sixteen-03.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-84161 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https:\/\/www.regentcollegelondon.com\/onemediadig\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/sweet-sixteen-03-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Sweet Sixteen\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.regentcollegelondon.com\/onemediadig\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/sweet-sixteen-06.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-84165 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https:\/\/www.regentcollegelondon.com\/onemediadig\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/sweet-sixteen-06-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Sweet Sixteen\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<style type=\"text\/css\">.post-featured{ display:none; } <\/style><\/div>\n\n\t\t\t            \t<div class=\"bottom-row__sidebar side-cards\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":11,"featured_media":1597,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[52],"tags":[],"course-type":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.4.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Sweet Sixteen - Regent College London<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"A personal story journey to business success through Regent College London.
