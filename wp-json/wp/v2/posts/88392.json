There\u2019s no such thing as over preparing, however, we know that you can prepare for everything, so it\u2019s best to prepare as much as you can. Whether you\u2019re living out or commuting from home, try to prepare for what you might be faced with. If you\u2019re living out, buy all the essentials needed weeks before you move into your accommodation and the same applies if you\u2019re commuting from home. Make sure you have all your stationery supplies ready, your travel card and everything else you may need.<\/p>\n<h2>Have a Budget<\/h2>\n<p>Its always best to create a monthly\/weekly budget to help keep on track of your finances. By budgeting, you will find yourself less stressed about financial worries, as a budget will help you spend what you can afford. Many universities have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prospects.ac.uk\/applying-for-university\/university-life\/making-the-most-of-freshers-week\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">freshers weeks<\/a> and many students take part and tend to spend quite a lot of money, which isn\u2019t an advisable thing to do, especially if you\u2019re student loan hasn\u2019t arrived into your account yet. We know planning a budget can sound serious, boring and make you feel like you\u2019re a lot older, but just spending 30 minutes a week can be really useful. Moreover, there are many apps that you can download to help keep your spending on track.<\/p>\n<h2>Find A Balance<\/h2>\n<p>As your social life starts to take off, so can your workload. The workload can be quite overwhelming and balancing that with your newly found social life can prove tricky and challenging. But, you don\u2019t need to worry, if you can perfect a social\/work life balance, you will find yourself less overwhelmed. This is where your time management skills come in handy!<\/p>\n<h2>Keep Healthy<\/h2>\n<p>Many parents worry that their child will be overwhelmed with the new university experience and forget to look after themselves. Its best to keep yourself healthy, mentally, and physically. When you get some spare time, try to be as active as you can and also remember to take care of yourself mentally too, whether that\u2019s taking a few minutes to meditate or read, find something that you will do for you!<\/p>\n<h2>Keep In Touch<\/h2>\n<p>With the first few weeks of university, you\u2019re meeting new faces and new friends, which makes it a great thing to keep in touch with those back home. Your friends, family and loved ones back at home would surely love to catch up with you and find out how your university experience is going.<\/p>\n<h2>Embrace University Life<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re living out or at home, try to embrace everything Higher Education has to offer. Make the most of the 9AM lectures, the social gatherings and of course the university experience itself. Embrace new opportunities and join society\u2019s if you can, its by taking up new challenges that you will find yourself growing as an individual, both professionally and personally. With that being said, always stay true to yourself, do things that only you wish to do, don\u2019t feel pressured into undertaking tasks that you don\u2019t want to do. <\/p>\n<h2>Back Up Your Work<\/h2>\n<p>We had to add in this cheeky little tip, always, always and always back up your work.
