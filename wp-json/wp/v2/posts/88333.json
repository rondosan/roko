Sticking to a routine gives your day structure and organising tasks and to-do lists will help manage your work flow. With a plan of action in place, you will feel less overwhelmed with the tasks at hand, and you can work through your list depending on your priorities and around your life commitments. <\/p>\n<h2>Relax and Refuel<\/h2>\n<p>Swiftly moving on to point two, which includes relaxing and refuelling. Many of us are working away at our computer screens for the whole day and then we look up towards the TV and then we switch to our phones, we\u2019re constantly exposing ourselves to some sort of screen light. Which is why it\u2019s important to take a little break away from our screens and do something we enjoy. Perhaps that\u2019s taking a little walk to get some fresh air or spending some time reading. Baking has also been a popular trend during lockdown and you might just find it could be the hobby for you. <\/p>\n<h2>Reconnect<\/h2>\n<p>With most of us tucked in doors for many hours of the day, its always a good idea to reconnect with our friends and family. That can be through <a href=\"https:\/\/zoom.us\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zoom<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-gb\/HT204380\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Facetime<\/a>, a simple phone call or meeting your loved ones safely. You will find that after catching up with someone you haven\u2019t spoken to in a while may help you reconnect with yourself and add a sense of normality back into your life. <\/p>\n<h2>Physical Health<\/h2>\n<p>Its important to keep ourselves active, healthy, and moving. Exercising is a great way of keeping fit and keeping us away from our screens. We can now go back into gyms and workout there, having a workout partner is a great way to keep you motivated. However, gyms and the \u2018typical\u2019 exercise isn\u2019t for everyone, but the best part is, you can find the activity you most enjoy doing and stick to it. Home workouts are great, convenient and pretty effective. There\u2019s also walking which helps you get out and about, swimming, dancing, playing tennis or even jogging are also worth giving a go.<\/p>\n<h2>Mental Health<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s also incredible important to look after our Mental Health. We should take care of our minds as much as we do our bodies, self-care is a great way to look after your mind and keep it healthy and happy. Things that you enjoy and help you relax are great activities to complete to look after your mental health. Many find reading and meditating takes their mind off any stresses. Others also find a digital detox a great away to switch off from our phones and the world of social media. Switching off your phone for the day or simply avoiding social media, may benefit you in ways you never thought it would. For Regent College London Students, we have a great <a href=\"\/studying-at-regent\/student-support\/\">Student Support Team<\/a> who are always on hand to help with any mental health support you may need.<\/p>\n<h2>Motivation and Enjoyment<\/h2>\n<p>In such times, its always important to motivate and keep yourself going. By doing the things you enjoy!<\/p><\/div>\n\n\t\t\t            \t<div class=\"bottom-row__sidebar side-cards\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":88334,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[34],"tags":[],"course-type":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.4.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Self-care tips for Students and finding a route<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"For Regent College Students, we have a great Student Support Team who are always on hand to help with any mental health support you may need.
