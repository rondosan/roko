The outcome of the UK Quality Assurance Agency\u2019s Review for Educational Oversight confirmed that the College reaches nationally prescribed benchmarks for educational delivery, pronouncing judgements of \u2018Confidence\u2019 in Regent College&#8217;s management of academic standards for which it is responsible, \u2018Confidence\u2019 in in Regent College&#8217;s management and enhancement of the quality of learning opportunities&nbsp; academic standards, and that \u2018Reliance\u2019 can be placed on the accuracy and completeness of the information that Regent College London is responsible for publishing about itself and the programmes it delivers. These outcomes ensure that our reputation is reported as of the highest calibre to the higher education sector as a whole, and also to the public at large; there are no concerns about the ways in which we are operating, and in academic terms we reach, and at times exceed, required standards.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #101010;\">Regent College London is also a UKVI Tier 4 Sponsor and we have just heard that our Tier 4 sponsorship will be renewed for yet another year.<!--Regent College London is also a Tier 4 licence holder and we have just heard that our Highly Trusted Sponsor status will be renewed for yet another year.--> We have also very recently achieved excellent outcomes from both the Annual Monitoring Review, in which we were given the highest category of judgement for all eight review areas and the Standards Verification process, of our awarding body Pearson\/Edexcel. Comments within these reports included, \u2018This is a very well-run college with very effective systems in place,\u2019 and, \u2018It has a highly motivated and well qualified team and is supported by good resources.\u2019 Both of these measures further enhance our growing reputation as a reliable and consistent provider of higher education to a varied and growing student constituency. We have been buoyed by these successes, and are considering expanding the provision into new subject areas and are also moving into further education opportunities.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #101010;\">This external confirmation of our commitment to standards seems especially relevant at a time when so-called \u2018alternative providers,\u2019 i.e. the private providers within the higher education sector, are undoubtedly under the spotlight as the government asks questions of the standard of provision in institutions such as ours and the amount of public funds directed towards alternative providers, and cases of alleged mis-use of these funds come to light. We responded to market requirements and achieved high standards in a very difficult market.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #101010;\">Further, Regent College London does its best to not only meet but to surpass governmental requirements. One such example, is our corporate governance where we are taking measures such as an internal audit function, establishing audit committees and remuneration committees,, a practice usually carried out by blue-chip companies as a corporate governance initiative.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #101010;\">When we were visited by our Edexcel Regional Quality Manager, he decided he would randomly sound out some of the students about their experiences at the College; he came back a little later and told us, \u2018I had a good chat with a number of your students and I asked them what the worst thing about the College was. They told me that the thing that bothered them the most here was the lack of student parking. If your students are telling you that\u2019s the worst thing about the College, then you know you\u2019re doing a pretty good job\u2019 and that, for us, sums it up.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>External measures of success, on sector-wide and nationally-based platforms, have provided us with the opportunity to promote the College in a positive way to a wider audience.
