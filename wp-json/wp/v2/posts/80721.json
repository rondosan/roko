Students were ready to share their experience and were more than willing to support work which will have a very real impact on how the Health Service responds to the needs of patients, helping to restore them to good health.<br \/>\nThe researchers were extremely pleased with the response, and pointed out how easy it was to work with the volunteers from Regent College. They reported that there was clearly a strongly committed student population, interested in issues beyond their own particular studies, who did not hold back in helping the community and contributing to the well-being of others.<br \/>\nThe visits by the research team took place on 21\/06\/16 and 23\/06\/16, with a series of one-to-one interviews. The findings from the interviews will be presented as a final report, and this report will contribute to how the Health Service moves forward in its support for its patients who suffer from any form of delusional belief. Regent College and its students are proud to have participated.<\/p>\n<style type=\"text\/css\">.post-featured{ display:none; } <\/style><\/div>\n\n\t\t\t            \t<div class=\"bottom-row__sidebar side-cards\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":11,"featured_media":87490,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[52],"tags":[],"course-type":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.4.1 -
