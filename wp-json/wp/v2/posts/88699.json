For now though, as we go into the second lockdown, we might find it hard to keep ourselves occupied. We might have completed everything we needed to in the first lockdown and you might be wondering what an earth am I going to do now? Well, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve written up a quick little blog post on a few things you can do to help pass your time.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rcl.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/What-to-do-in-Lockdown-2.0.jpg\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.rcl.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/What-to-do-in-Lockdown-2.0.jpg\" alt=\" What to do in Lockdown 2.0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-88700\" srcset=\"https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/What-to-do-in-Lockdown-2.0.jpg 602w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/What-to-do-in-Lockdown-2.0-150x100.jpg 150w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/What-to-do-in-Lockdown-2.0-576x383.jpg 576w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Host a Games Night<\/h2>\n<p>\u2018Can you hear me?\u2019 \u2013 The most common phrase of 2020! We all know how Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Skype and many more software\u2019s became the \u2018hit\u2019 of the first lockdown and it looks like they\u2019re about to make a return! So why not host a Games Night with your friends and family? You can take inspiration from Google, play some classic games or perhaps create your own. It\u2019s incredibly important to keep in touch with our loved ones and a weekly games night will definitely help.<\/p>\n<h2>Download Streaming Services<\/h2>\n<p>You might have gotten tired of daytime TV, so why not subscribe to a streaming service or two, if you can. There\u2019s a range to choose from, Netflix, Disney+, NOWTV, Amazon Prime and much more! The best part is that you can always find what you\u2019re looking for. If you\u2019re looking to watch something educational, or an adventurous movie, you will surely be kept entertained.<\/p>\n<h2>Practice your culinary skills<\/h2>\n<p>You may have missed out on the chance to work on your cooking and baking skills during Lockdown 1.0, so why not do so now? There are many resources online and many cookery programmes available that will help you perfect your favourite dish. Another great idea is to recreate your favourite restaurant style dish at home.!<\/p>\n<h2>Get ready for the Festive Season<\/h2>\n<p>What better time is it to get prepared for Christmas?! As we\u2019re all tucked in our homes to help keep us out of the Winter cold, it\u2019s a great time to get into the Festive Spirit! Whether that\u2019s listening to Christmas Songs, watching the Christmas Movies or simply sorting out your Christmas Decorations, they are all bound to keep you busy and help you during the Festive Season. As this year is going to be pretty different to the others, traditions might not be able to be held, so why not create new traditions? You can make them as fun and exciting as you wish! <\/p>\n<h2>Look into your Family History<\/h2>\n<p>This can be quite interesting, many are always wondering about their ancestry and their roots, why not take a deeper look in Lockdown 2.0? There\u2019s great websites out there that help you delve into your family history. Their records contain a range of information censuses, wills, birth records and even records of people\u2019s jobs. You\u2019re bound to find more relatives than you ever know!<\/p>\n<h2>Organise your phone<\/h2>\n<p>Many organised their homes in March and did things they have been putting off, but have you ever thought about organising your phone? Deleting old photos, contacts, apps and anything off your phone with no use can be very therapeutic!<\/p>\n<h2>Virtual Events<\/h2>\n<p>With physical events a thing of the past, many companies are hosting virtual events which you can get involved in. We know they\u2019re not exactly the same but they can surely help you feel part of a community. Taking part of a virtual event will also help you get excited to be a part of something, Lockdown can get quite boring, so having an event to look forward too is always a good thing!<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rcl.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Lockdown-part-two-in-London-and-what-to-do.jpg\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.rcl.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Lockdown-part-two-in-London-and-what-to-do.jpg\" alt=\"Lockdown part two in London and what to do\" width=\"100%\" height=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-88701\" srcset=\"https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Lockdown-part-two-in-London-and-what-to-do.jpg 1202w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Lockdown-part-two-in-London-and-what-to-do-768x511.jpg 768w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Lockdown-part-two-in-London-and-what-to-do-991x660.jpg 991w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Lockdown-part-two-in-London-and-what-to-do-150x100.jpg 150w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Lockdown-part-two-in-London-and-what-to-do-576x383.jpg 576w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Lockdown-part-two-in-London-and-what-to-do-992x660.jpg 992w,   https:\/\/3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Lockdown-part-two-in-London-and-what-to-do-1200x799.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1202px) 100vw, 1202px\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Learn a Language<\/h2>\n<p>How about learning a language?
