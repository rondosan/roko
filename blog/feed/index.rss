	        <div class="bottom-row__inner rich-text"><p>It’s April 2021 and although some restrictions are easing, virtual events are here to stay for the foreseeable future. Ever since the pandemic hit, the events industry has had to adapt to streaming events online. There have been many benefits to hosting virtual events, for example, organisers are able to reach wider audiences, and from different parts of the world. Which works out great for us, as here in London, we’re able to ‘attend’ events that take place all over Britain. And on that note, we have listed a handful of great events that you can be a part of…<br />

	        <div class="bottom-row__inner rich-text"><p>When you’re applying for University, you’ve always got the crucial Student Finance at the back of your mind. There’s so much to know when it comes to Student Finance, the different loans, support, the amount you’re eligible for, the list can go on! Let’s start with what Student Finance actually is, Student Finance is a type of Loan. The loan is designed to help students pay for post-secondary education and the associated fees, such as tuition, books and supplies, and living expenses. There are different amounts of the loan available, and that is dependent on your financial circumstances, your parents’ income, and many additional factors. So, let’s get into the blog post!<br />
&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is available?</h2>
<p>The type of loan you may be eligible for is dependent on your level of study. For Undergraduates:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tuition Fee Loan</b> &#8211; You may be eligible to borrow money to help pay for university or college tuition fees. This loan is then paid directly to your University to cover the cost of your course. This loan will need to be repaid, which is dependent on your income.</li>
<li><b>Maintenance Loan</b> &#8211; Depending on your eligibility, you may be able to apply for a maintenance loan, which is designed to help you with the cost of living as a student. This loan is paid directly to you (at the start of each term). Unlike the tuition fee, this will be paid directly into your bank account. The amount you are entitled to is dependent on your household income. Similar to the Tuition Fee Loan, you will also need to pay this back.</li>
<p>Whereas, for Postgraduates, the Postgraduate Loan is available:</p>
<li><b>Postgraduate Loan</b> – This differs slightly from the structure of an Undergraduate loan as all of the money is paid directly to you as the student. It is your responsibility to pay the tuition fees to the University. You will be paid at the start of each term and the necessary payment will need to be made. It’s important to note that this loan is given to cover the course of your university and living fees, so it may be worthwhile budgeting accordingly. Just like with the other Loans mentioned, this will also need to be repaid.</li>
<p>There are also additional forms of support available: </p>
<li>Childcare Grant</li>
<li>Parent Learning Allowance</li>
<li>Adult Dependents Grant</li>
<li>Disabled Student Allowance</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do I apply for Student Finance?</h2>
<p>The next important step is to apply! It may sound and feel like a daunting application but in actual fact, it’s pretty simple and straightforward. You will need to have a few pieces of evidence and proof on hand to submit with your application, but whatever form of document you need will be asked from you within the application. We’ve left a few pointers below on How to Apply for Student Finance:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can apply online via the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/student-finance" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Student Finance Website</a>. If you haven’t already got an account online, you will need to create an account. This will mainly consist of you providing Student Finance with your personal details.</li>
<li>Once you have created your account you will need to make your application (<b>please do this as soon as possible to avoid delays in the receipt of your funding</b>).</li>
<li>The questions that follow will be about you and your personal circumstances.</li>
<li>You will then be given options on what you’re studying, the higher education level (Undergraduate/Postgraduate) as well as the duration you plan to study for (Full-time/Parttime), in addition to other factors that Student Finance England will need to consider. It is extremely important that you select the correct university and course in order for your payments to be made in time as selecting the wrong course can delay the process of approval and also your payments being made, even if the application is approved.</li>
<li>Once you have agreed to the Terms and Conditions and submitted your application, you will be presented with a checklist/to do list on your account home page. This will tell you what additional information you need to send to Student Finance, which will be used to support your application. For example, proof of address or your bank account details. <b>Please ensure that you send any required evidence in as soon as possible.</b></li>
<li>In some circumstances, you may be required to complete a paper application which you will have to fill out.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that the ‘hard’ part is all done and dusted, it’s time to wait. It can take 6-8 weeks (sometimes longer in peak periods) for your application to be processed. If you have sent in additional evidence it can take longer as these will need to be assessed. </p>
<p>When your application is approved, you will be sent a ‘Notification of Entitlement’ which is a letter that shows what you have been awarded and your scheduled payment dates.</p>

<p>Once your application is approved and you are successfully enrolled, your place of study will confirm your Registration to Student Finance, who will then release your maintenance payments to you. In order to ensure you receive your maintenance payments, it is important you maintain a high level of attendance.</p>
<h2>What if I cannot secure funding?</h2>
<p>There are a number of reasons as to why you may not be eligible to receive funding, some of which are below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nationality/Residency Status</li>
<li>Previous Study</li>
<li>Holding an equivalent or higher qualification</li>
</ul>
<p>If for any reason you are unable to secure funding, you will be required to pay the fees yourself as a<br />
Private Payer. Payment plans can be setup with the team.</p>
<h2>I have applied for the wrong course or made a mistake on my application, what do I do?</h2>
<p>You can complete a CO1 form, this is provided by Student Finance and you will be able to amend the details on your application. However, if the application is approved, we can amend any course details for you via a Change of Circumstances (COC) sent directly to Student Finance.</p>
<h2>When do I apply for Student Finance?</h2>
<p>It’s best advised to apply for your <a href="https://www.rcl.ac.uk/studying-at-regent/how-to-apply-for-a-course/#step5">Student Loan</a> as soon as possible, this is to avoid any delays in your application. If you have decided what institution you wish to study at, you should then apply for student finance. </p>
<h2>How do I know if my Student Finance is approved?</h2>
<p>You can login online to check the progress or status of your application <a href="https://www.gov.uk/student-finance-register-login" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/student-finance-register-login</a> you will also receive a letter from Student Finance, notifying you of your approval and outlining any scheduled payments to both you and your university. </p>
<h2>What should I do when my Student Finance application is approved?</h2>
<p>Once your loan application is approved, you should bring the letter of approval into your university and hand this in. You should then ensure that you are in full attendance of your classes.</p>
<h2>When will I receive my maintenance payments?</h2>
<p>You will usually receive your maintenance payments 3-5 days after your university or college has confirmed your registration to Student Finance. This is subject to you maintaining a high level of attendance and meeting enrolment criteria.</p>
<h2>How will my tuition fee be paid?</h2>
<p>Providing you have an approved tuition fee loan, your tuition fees will be paid directly to your university or college.</p>
<h2>How much Student Funding will I receive?</h2>
<p>The amount of student funding you are eligible to receive is dependent on various factors such asyour age, where you live and who you live with. If you have people who are financially dependent on you, such as children or a partner, you may be eligible for additional grants. SLC will assess the level of household income received in the previous full tax year. </p>
<h2>Do I have to apply every year for Student Finance?</h2>
<p>Yes, you will have to apply yearly.</p>
<h2>How do I repay my Loan?</h2>
<p>You will need to <a href="https://www.ucas.com/student-finance-england/repaying-your-student-loan" rel="noopener" target="_blank">repay your loan</a> once you have finished your course and when your annual income is over £26,575 (£27,295 from the 2021/22 Year). This will automatically be taken from your monthly pay and can be seen on your payslip. Student Finance will adjust the repayment amount accordingly, and in line with your annual income.</p>
<h2>I have already studied at higher education level, will I be eligible for funding?</h2>
<p>Typically you will only be funded for your first full degree. If you hold an equivalent or higher qualification, from anywhere in the world, it is unlikely you will be able to receive a tuition fee loan.</p>
<p>If you studied previously but did not complete the course, this may still affect your eligibility. </p>
<h2>Will my payments be affected if I take a Career Break or become Unemployed?</h2>
<p>This will dependent on your situation, however, you will need to notify Student Finance England and they will then assess the circumstances and offer guidance.</p>
<h2>Will Student Finance affect future Money Commitments such as Mortgages?</h2>
<p>It does have an impact on Mortgages as you will have a loan to your name, however, this isn’t crucial nor held against you when applying for mortgages.</p>

	        <div class="bottom-row__inner rich-text"><p>Although Open Days have changed and become virtual, you can still take advantage attending a Virtual Open Day. Virtual Open Days are a great way to find out more about different universities and their courses, whilst offering you a chance to engage with Q + A’s with various staff members. At Regent College London, we hosted our very first Virtual Open Day in February and it was a success, so we are thrilled to announce three Virtual Open Days in March! Scroll right to the bottom of the page to register for any date that suits you best! Virtual Open Days are becoming widely popular and you may be wondering how to make the most out of the virtual experience? Well we’ve got you covered, we’re going to be listing great ways to take full advantage, as well as why you should attend a <a href="https://www.rcl.ac.uk/our-college/open-days/">Virtual Open Day</a> with Regent College London.</p>

<h2>Why Should I attend a Virtual Open Day?</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with why you should attend a Virtual Open Day. They’re great to help you gain much more in-depth information about Regent College London, the different courses on offer, and much more.</p>
<p>At our virtual open day, you will hear from our Principal, Heads of Schools, expert Academic Faculty, Recruitment and Admissions Officers, Student Finance Manager about applying and studying at Regent College London. You can find out all you need to know about our <a href="https://www.rcl.ac.uk/courses/">higher education courses</a>, our transformational learning programmes and the digital delivery of our courses. Or you could ask our students directly about their experience.</p>
<h2>Why Attend a Virtual Open Day?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Find out about our range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses</li>
<li>Meet and chat online with the various Heads of Schools</li>
<li>Chat with our recruitment team about the course entry requirements and the application<br />
process</li>
<li>Find out about our English language requirements and free English language support</li>
<li>Get information and guidance on Student Finance</li>
<li>Get your questions answered and find out which course is best suited for you</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to take full advantage of a Virtual Open Day</h2>
<h3>Understand how they work</h3>
<p>Although Open Days are now completed online, the principle still remains the same; to get more information on the universities, the different courses available to you, student finance and much more. However, the main difference is the format of the event as well as the duration. For this, it’s best to understand how the Virtual Open Day you’re attending is going to work, for example, where the event is going to be hosted (Zoom, Skype etc) and also the agenda for the event.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.rcl.ac.uk/our-college/why-study-at-regent/">Regent College London</a>, we set out the Virtual Open Day Agenda on the website, allowing the attendees to have a read through and understand the running order of events on the day. We cover a range of topics, from student finance, a student panel and much more. You can read all about our Virtual Open Day Agenda <a href="https://www.rcl.ac.uk/our-college/open-days/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Internet Connection</h3>
<p>As with everything we have had to do over the past year, you should try to have a stable internet connection to partake in the event properly. You want to be able to get the most out of the Virtual Open Day and wouldn’t want to spend it logging back in and out. Also, with a better internet connection you will be able to navigate yourself around the session effectively.</p>
<p>The Regent College London Virtual Open Days allow you to take part in our Breakout Sessions which feature:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coffee and chat with the Principal –</strong> <a href="https://www.rcl.ac.uk/our-college/our-team/">Dr Selva Pankaj</a></li>
<li><strong>More than just academic learning –</strong> an introduction to our transformational learning programmes – Dr Chris Wood, Head of Research and Enrichment</li>
<li><strong>Digital academic delivery –</strong> Mr Matthew Vose, Digital Learning Manager</li>
<li><strong>How to apply –</strong> Ms Anelis Tarabuta, Admissions, Recruitment and Widening Access (ARWA) Officer and Mr Charitha Waduge Admissions, Recruitment and Widening Access (ARWA) Officer</li>
<li><strong>English language requirements and pre-sessional English support –</strong> Mr Scott Bushell, Head of International Recruitment and School of Click English</li>
<li><strong>Student finance –</strong> Mr Rhonan Dunphy, SLC Manager</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prepare any Questions</h2>
<p>As with any Virtual Open Day, you will want to ask as many questions as possible, so its best to have them prepared beforehand, just so you don’t forget any.</p>
<p>You will find that with the <a href="https://www.rcl.ac.uk/our-college/open-days/">Regent College London Virtual Open Days</a>, you will be able to ask staff members an array of questions. You will also have the chance to ask current Regent College London students any other questions you may have. That would be great to take advantage of, as you are able to receive answers based on a students perspective and get a little idea of how that may reflect your time at Regent College London.</p>

	        <div class="bottom-row__inner rich-text"><p>With Lockdown 3.0 and Half-term in full swing, it may be a little bit difficult juggling family life, studying and keeping everything else going. Virtual events are a great way of escaping reality for a little while and focusing your mind elsewhere. We know it’s the not the same as physically doing an activity, but virtual events will have to do for now!

The world of events has been completely turned upside down, with every event either becoming a Drive-Through or of course, through Zoom, MS Teams, Skype, the list goes on! Although it’s not the same, virtual events are still a great way of keeping connected and they offer you a form of escapism. For today’s post, we thought we would write up a little round up of all the virtual events taking place in January 2021!</p>

	        <div class="bottom-row__inner rich-text"><p>Choosing to study into Higher Education is always a tough decision, but what makes it harder, is choosing the type of Higher Education and the course that suits your career the best. There are many different factors that students look for when picking a course, it depends on where they see their career going, the type of Degree, and of course other factors such as campus location, etc. We thought we would make your decision that little bit easier by breaking down the types of Degrees Regent College London offers, as well as the courses that fall into them!</p>

<h2>Foundation Degrees</h2>
<p>A <a href="/courses/foundation-degrees/">Foundation Degree</a> is a two-year stand-alone qualification in its own right. After completing this you can go to the final year of degree as well or complete a Top-up and gain a degree. This qualification is equivalent to two-thirds of a Bachelor’s degree, and a Higher National Diploma (HND): Level 4 and 5.</p>
<p>We know it can get a little confusing with there being Foundation Year with Degrees and Foundation Degrees, but they are two completely different qualifications. A Foundation Year with Degree, is an extra year of learning and gaining new skills and knowledge before moving onto a BSc or BA. If you pass the foundation year, it’s almost, very likely you will move onto the 1st or 2nd Year of a Bachelor’s (Hons) Degree. Whereas a Foundation Degree is different as explained above.</p>
<p>So, we’ve spoken about why you may want to take a Foundation Year with Degree, but what if a Foundation Degree is for you? Our Foundation Degrees are designed to help explore different aspects of your subject area and include both theoretical and practical learning methods. Many students work whilst completing their Foundation Degree, which is why we offer flexible timetables.</p>
<p>A Foundation Degree can allow you to enter many different career fields such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Advertising and marketing</li>
<li>Accountancy</li>
<li>Human resources</li>
<li>Banking</li>
<li>Management consultancy</li>
</ol>
<p>The Foundation Course we offer is the <a href="/courses/foundation-degrees/fdsc-business-management/">FdSc Business Management</a>.</p>

But knowing many of us are in the same situation, can help, along with knowing how to write effectively and efficiently. Assessments can take quite some time to complete, but the relief when they are done is the best feeling. But what if we can help you get less stressed about starting an assessment? We have put together a little list of tips that might help you when it comes to writing your assessments!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://www.rcl.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-for-Writing-Student-Assessments.jpg"><img src="https://www.rcl.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-for-Writing-Student-Assessments.jpg" alt="Tips for Writing Student Assessments" width="100%" height="" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-88841" srcset="https://3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-for-Writing-Student-Assessments.jpg 1202w, https://3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-for-Writing-Student-Assessments-768x511.jpg 768w, https://3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-for-Writing-Student-Assessments-991x660.jpg 991w, https://3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-for-Writing-Student-Assessments-150x100.jpg 150w, https://3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-for-Writing-Student-Assessments-576x383.jpg 576w, https://3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-for-Writing-Student-Assessments-992x660.jpg 992w, https://3arol9bs7qh145m57r5fbq9p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-for-Writing-Student-Assessments-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1202px) 100vw, 1202px" /></a><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Focus on the Topic</h2>
<p>When it comes to writing assessments, its best to make a list of points you wish to talk about in your text. It’s these bullet points that help you focus on the topic at hand. Every assessment differs and focuses on different topics, and it helps to plan around your points. Once you have all the points you need to talk about, try and extend them further. For example, if you had an assessment due on Business Law, and you have a point for your answer, add to your point, take it to a deeper level. Its by doing this that you are showing the tutor/examiner that you have explored each point in detail and have truly focused on the assessment.</p>
<h2>Quality, not Quantity</h2>
<p>Exploring points is always a good idea, however, have you ever heard of the saying ‘Quality, not Quantity?’ It’s true, your tutor is able to tell when you are dragging out your points by adding unnecessary details. Stick to the point you need to raise, explore it in detail, but only if exploration is needed, if the point doesn’t need to be taken deeper, then there is no use in waffling on. Yes, you may have a word limit or minimum you need to hit, but keep your writing concise and as close to what you have been asked to discuss.</p>
<h2>Include different levels of Sentences</h2>
<p>A great tip for writing assessments, especially English assessments, is to include a variation of sentences. That includes, long and short sentences. These help your points in a different manor and shows your tutor that you can explain your point both in detail, and within a shorter form too. When using different lengths of sentences, it also adds to depth to your assessment and makes it more intriguing to read.</p>
<h2>Provide both sides to the argument</h2>
<p>Obviously, only if the assessment requires to do so. Many assessments ask that students argue both for and against the question. If you are asked to do, make sure you raise both sides of the argument to a high level, this can be done by keeping your points strong and concise. If you find that one side outweighs the other, make those points for that side stronger. Also, when concluding your assessment, you will need to voice which side of the argument you agree with. In doing so, rounding up the points in your favour will help show the tutor that you have looked at both sides of the argument on a deep level and have come a conclusion effectively. </p>
<h2>Consistency with Tenses</h2>
<p>One issue that students can face is moving back and forth between the past and present tenses. When writing an assessment, it is best to either stick to the present or past tense. However, if your assessment requires you to switch between the past and present tenses, make sure you do so carefully as it can get quite confusing for the reader if done so incorrectly.</p>
<h2>Take advantage of the online Thesaurus</h2>
<p>A great tip for writing assessments and taking them to the next level is to use a physical or online thesaurus. By using a <a href="https://www.thesaurus.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Thesaurus</a> you are able to expand your vocabulary and that will come across in your piece. Simple words like however and therefore can be overused in assessments, but, with a thesaurus, you are able to find another word that you need, but one that holds the same meaning.<br />

&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Plan, Draft, Read and Edit</h2>
<p>The most important thing you can do is to plan, draft, read and edit your assessment. Plan all your points in detail, make sure you have them in the correct order and that they flow effectively. Then draft, write as many drafts as you need, it’s with a draft that you are able to make the changes you need to make your assessment the best possible. Next up is reading, read and read your assessments a good few times and also, read it out loud. When reading out loud, you will be able to pick up on grammar and punctuation mistakes and you will get a real feel of how the tutor will read your assessment. And lastly, edit your assessment as much as you wish, when you edit, you will find that some points may be unnecessary, or that there are some more you wish to add.</p>

<p>‘You are never too old to learn’ – ‘Learning never stops’. We’re pretty sure you may have come across these quotes, and rightly so, as they remain accurate. At <a href="https://www.rcl.ac.uk/"><strong>Regent College London</strong></a> we are proud to have a diverse student base who come from different walks of life. We encourage students of all ages to take up higher or further education with us, as it is true, ‘You are never too old to learn’. Have you ever thought about returning to education? And if so, have you thought about what you wish to learn, and how you can take your current career to a new level? Or perhaps, you have had a breakthrough and want to start a new career, but need the qualifications to do so? It can be quite scary going to university, or studying higher/further at an older age, but it really doesn’t need to be. We’ve put together a quick blog post about being a mature student and returning to education.<br />

<li><strong>Location of the Campus:</strong> Many mature students like to stay closer to home, in order to fulfil any existing life commitments. When choosing where to study, its essential to know of your route to getting to campus and what other facilities are available, such as car parking. Regent College London have <a href="https://www.rcl.ac.uk/campuses/">5 Campus Locations</a> across London, all with great transport links.</li>
<li><strong>The Length/Duration of your Course:</strong> Many students often can’t commit to a longer length of degree, which is why it’s essential to know of the duration of your degree. From choosing your degree, you will be able to plan around your future and any other commitments you might be faced with.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Preparing for Study</strong></p>
<p>When you’re older, there can be a lot more to think about when making life decisions, it can be a pretty scary thought. Preparing for academic life might be a challenge, but preparing yourself can make everything a lot easier. Just knowing that you have things in place that will help you along your higher/further education journey, and helps put your mind at ease. Before you start an application, try to think carefully about any additional support you will need during your transition to study. For example, if you have family commitments, you may need to look into childcare options or facilities to provide support. A few tips that might help you once you start studying are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Taking time to Settle:</strong> Settling in will take time and adapting to student life can take some adjustment. It can prove quite challenging balancing your education with any life commitments. However, once you have firmly planted your feet on campus, you will be a very settled student!</li>
<li><strong>Making friends:</strong> Everyone can face a challenge when making friends, but finding common interests with fellow students can help build bonds. Mature students often find common ground about work, family and general life commitments, so there really is no need to worry about getting to know your fellow students. Your friends will then be there to provide mutual support if you feel you need any help.</li>
<li><strong>Juggling Commitments:</strong> We know as a mature student, you probably have more commitments and responsibilities than a student who has just left school. But that doesn’t mean you can balance them all! It’s a great thing that Regent College London offer flexible timetables with classes running during the Weekdays, Evenings and Weekends.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Financial Stability</strong></p>
<p>It can be quite a worry for those returning to education to think about Financial Stability. Higher Education is a massive investment in your future and once you have made the decision to study, you will need to consider how to fund your studies. There is student finance available for those who wish to take on a degree. At <a href="https://www.rcl.ac.uk/8-reasons-to-choose-regent-college-london/">Regent College London</a>, we have dedicated Student Finance Officers to help you every step of the way of your Student Finance application.</p>
